# ReactJS_Portfolio

# HTML & CSS Portfolio Conversion to React App  

## Description This project is a React-based version of a portfolio that was originally built using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this conversion is to leverage React's component-based architecture for better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The updated portfolio not only replicates the original design but also introduces modern development practices and features.  ## Features - **Reusable Components:** Key sections of the portfolio (e.g., header, projects, about) are now modular React components for easy updates. - **Dynamic Rendering:** Uses React props and states to dynamically render portfolio items and sections. - **Improved Performance:** Optimized with React's virtual DOM for faster rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation. - **Responsive Design:** Maintains the responsive styling from the original portfolio while integrating reusable design components. - **Modern Tooling:** Built with modern React tooling using Vite for fast development and efficient bundling.  ## Technology Stack - **React**: For building the UI components. - **Vite**: For rapid development and optimized builds. - **CSS**: For styling the components, migrated from the original CSS. - **Git**: Version control.  ## Setup Instructions To run the project locally:  1. Clone the repository:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-Arabi/Orange_Projects.git    cd Portfolio  î·›î·œî·™î·š - Install dependencies:npm install  - Start the development server:npm run dev  - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.  Future Improvements - API Integration: Introduce dynamic features like fetching projects from a backend or external API. - Dark Mode: Implement a theme toggle using CSS variables and global state management. - Accessibility: Enhance accessibility features for better user experience.  Contributing Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request for any improvements or new features.
