# HTML & CSS Portfolio Conversion to React App

## Description
This project is a React-based version of a portfolio that was originally built using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this conversion is to leverage React's component-based architecture for better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The updated portfolio not only replicates the original design but also introduces modern development practices and features.

## Features
- **Reusable Components:** Key sections of the portfolio (e.g., header, projects, about) are now modular React components for easy updates.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Uses React props and states to dynamically render portfolio items and sections.
- **Improved Performance:** Optimized with React's virtual DOM for faster rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation.
- **Responsive Design:** Maintains the responsive styling from the original portfolio while integrating reusable design components.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with modern React tooling using Vite for fast development and efficient bundling.

## Technology Stack
- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **Vite**: For rapid development and optimized builds.
- **CSS**: For styling the components, migrated from the original CSS.
- **Git**: Version control.
